# `calcHeuristicCosts`

### `calcMinCost(parentNode)`
Calculates and assigns the heuristic estimate of the minimum cost of a complete subtree (i.e., reaches terminal nodes) that can be constructed from each node that descends from `parentNode` (via one of its subnodes). These values serve as admissible heuristics in the A* search of the parse forest.

The cost of a subtree/path is the sum of the minimum cost of all node in the subtree, excluding the cost of `parentNode`. The parent node's cost is excluded in the sum because there are several possible costs for the node (to add to the minimum cost of a path in `pfsearch`) when there is a `ruleProps` array (i.e., multiple insertions).

#### Arguments
- `parentNode` *(Object)*: The node for which to calculate and assign the minimum cost of a descendant subtree (from one of its subnodes).

#### Returns
*(number)*: Returns the minimum cost of a subtree that descends from `parentNode`.

### Recursive Node Restriction:
A unique node is created for each instance of a nonterminal symbol with a unique input token index or unique input token span. Hence, a node could only every be a subnode of itself (i.e., recursive) if a nonterminal symbol made multiple appearances at the same input token index with the same input token span. This is only possible if a nonterminal symbol produces itself via a recursive sequence of unary rules (i.e., reductions); e.g., "X -> Y -> X".

The grammar generator currently forbids such rules until `calcHeuristicCosts` is extended to support recursive unary reductions. This calculation is possible, though difficult to design due to the complexity of the interdependence of the minimum cost heuristics. E.g., a node's minimum cost (heuristic) is a function of its descendants' minimum costs, yet the minimum cost of the recursive descendant node is a function of the original (ancestor) node's minimum cost to which it points. There is no implementation because its difficulty was debilitating and demoralizing in the face of all other remaining work the system requires.

Furthermore, handling this complexity might decrease the operation's performance disproportionately for such an obscure edge case (i.e., the case that needs the insertion rules that require the recursion). One potential implementation removes `calcHeuristicCosts` and calculates the cost heuristics while reducing in `Parser`: In `Parser.prototype.addNode()`, determine if a node's minimum cost is lower than its parent node's previous minimum cost; if so, traverse up the vertices updating the minimum costs of parent nodes.

If a solution were implemented, the grammar generator will only forbid recursive sequences of unary non-edit rules; i.e., sequences that involve at least one insertion rule will be permitted because otherwise multiple traversal by `pfsearch` of the same path of non-edit rules guarantees semantic duplicity.

In addition, support for recursive nodes will enable `pfsearch` to process indefinitely until halted, though it will continue to discard paths for producing duplicate semantics after using every possible variation the insertions enable. This requires extending `pfsearch` with the yet-to-implement exit timer for input queries that do not produce `k` unique, complete parse trees (e.g., unavoidably semantically illegal input queries that require reparsing with additional deletions).
