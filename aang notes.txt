always design grammar before building
make a list of every query to support


dropbox and email are both necessary for enterprise software
start with dropbox: dropbox can easily download index and load into elastic search
- eventually will need full text search of dropbox


I also want to do Twitter for my own use, but each will be converted into an API request
- and some searches will be rejected because not possible
- maybe not, how complicated can the intersections become? 4 at most?
- - but you are limited to 1000 per search, so after doing an intersection you might need to go back and get more


start with only a few queries, and slowly and carefully evolve
