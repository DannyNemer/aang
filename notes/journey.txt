** The file serves as a log of the development process, but was created over 2 years after I began working toward this by any measure. Previous comments by me are scattered throughout several other files that I will merge here later. This file is meant to demonstrate the difficulty of the process and what I learned.

- Ending working on recreating the grammar. I never built a functional prototype. Several rules are missing, and did not perfect rule, semantic generation, display text generation, string edit costs, edit rules (I have too many), and disambiguation. But I understand 99.9% of it, and the reasons for every design choice. There is some inconsistency amongst rules, but I understand it so well that I can make my own choices.
- While making my grammar, I can go back to the previous grammar and adopt my new code to check that it works - especially the parser. The few things I have not solved, like how to use insertion costs of terms in portions of larger term symbols, and few display text rules and semantic function placement, I hope to solve by after gaining more knowledge through this process.
- Work on the new grammar, codename aang, will be very slow and careful. Code will be modular, well-commented, optimized, and committed frequently.

- I am scared about designing the culture. I know it is the most important part. It determines success. It establishes the processes and priorities that that company will, often unknowingly, follow and make all decisions. For me to implement it best, thoroughly and consistently, it must be an extension of my own character. Then, it flow naturally and always. Therefore, I must strive to make an ideal version of myself. My first principles, value system, work ethic, virtues, habits.
- There needs to be documented processes, like Apple. Rules from behavior (like rules.txt). Everything is thought throughout: workspace, meetings, formality vs informality, tone. Will need to inspire passion, but not deter. Will need brutal honesty without hurt feelings. Complete trust.

- My startup will succeed not because of tech or design, but because of culture. My passion, work ethic, character, care for doing the best and being the best will succeed. Virtue.

- I just stop when I realize how fast technology is evolving, and can see the acceleration. Mind blowing. More was accomplished in last 100 years than previous 500 years. And when you think about material intelligence, we are all getting smarter. And the population is growing, and the people with access to education and resources are growing. The next ten years will be unfathomable. Indeed, incredibly good: living standard rise, diseases cured, children fed, sick treated, access to infrastructure such as plumbing and transpiration, stable governments, etc. While not adjective can sufficiently describe the enormity of this good, my mind is stalled by the difficulty to comprehend such magnitude of velocity of change (velocity's direction: good).

- Bret Victor's Bio (see more): Yet I sought, and I thought, and I pursued my own path. And with time, I was enlightened. The True Way transcends the minutia of Skill. There is no "Technology". There is no "Design". There is only a version of how mankind should be, and the relentless resolve to make it so. The rest is details. This is the Way that I teach.

- It may not be a way to search an enterprise's store of email and files (Slack does that). It make not be a search engine for structured date: financial + market data (people don't really do that). It needs to be something I want now, like how I wanted Slack. I want it to search Twitter, for one. I might discover other applications later, too.
- I will do, as Gruber describes Apple: Thatâ€™s how they develop products: come up with a slew of ideas, try the ideas that seem best, iterate and refine and change (narrowing focus) until they get to something that feels right.
- I will get the grammar + parser + search-index working, and try a lot things. Twitter, Dropbox, email, Wikidata, personal productivity (e.g., reminders), Github. I will find more. Maybe I'll have SJ's moment when he looked at the multi-touch display with inertia scroll and said, "Wow. We can make a phone out of this. So we put the tablet project on the shelf."
- It's a new interface. iPhone's email and Maps were obviously better than existing, but Maps was the last application made before the keynote (then YouTube app before launch).

- When people half way around the world are praying. Praying for the drought to end so they can feed their children. Praying that disease that killed their father doesn't kill their mother. They aren't praying for their god to help. They are praying for us to help. We all can be angels. We all can be heroes. This is what I knew I wanted to do with my life since I was 16. I knew would work harder than anyone else, and study more than anyone else, to accrue the resources necessary to do good on a mass scale. I'm good at business, engineering, and design so that I may do this. This is what I have always wanted to do with my life. The rest is a means to this end.

- Haptic trackpad required 20 years of research to invent the tech AND huge engineering effort within Apple to innovate a product. Need both!

- Keep removing features until it is brain-dead simple; like Picasso's bull.

- Draw on latent powers of humans. Not using them is inhumane. Use all capabilities. Seeing Bret's Humane Representation of Thought
