always design grammar before building
- make a list of every query to support

Start with Github for simiplicity and fun as you design the grammar.

dropbox and email are both necessary for enterprise software
start with dropbox: dropbox can easily download index and load into elastic search
- eventually will need full text search of dropbox

I also want to do Twitter for my own use, but each will be converted into an API request
- and some searches will be rejected because not possible
- maybe not, how complicated can the intersections become? 4 at most?
- - but you are limited to 1000 per search, so after doing an intersection you might need to go back and get more

Make an entirely functional, optimized, and commented system, with edits (insertion, deletion, transposistion, substitution), display text generation, semantic function, parsing, disambiguation, etc. for only a few queries (10?). Will increase complexity over time.
