Perhaps have "github" leading before entity types that apply to many ('followers'), but not those specific to GitHub (repositories)

Github:
people I follow
users I follow
people I followed
Facebook people I followed
people I follow on Facebook
people I following on Facebook
people I am following
people I be following
people I is following
people I were following
people I have been following
people I did follow
people followed by me
people that have been following by me
people that have been followed by me
people I'm following
people that I follow
people who I follow
people who I followed
people whom I follow
people being followed by me
people that are being followed by me
people who are being followed by me
people who I am following
people I have followed

people {user} follows
my repos
my public repos
{user}'s repos
repos I starred

if you typed:
people I follow: should it then show you all of your services?
